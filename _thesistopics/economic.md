### Context
In economics, firm level data can be used to measure resource allocation. This is relevant because resource misallocation (having unproductive firms using more resources than what is efficient) can explain big differences in the production of different economies. However, the standard assumption is that the production function of firms differ only in their productivity and not in their input intensities. Recently, a model was proposed breaking such assumption --that is having different productions for different firms. This model is beneficial in order to have a better assessment of misallocation. The better the data can be fitted to the model, the better this assessment will be.
 
### Objective
The objective of this project is to estimate the production function of firms to produce a more appropriate model for their resource usage. The first step in this process is to detect which product a firm produces, taking into account its production information. Such detection can be done by a predictive (i.e., machine learning) algorithm, applied to firm level historic data. Once detected, firms of the same type can be clustered together, adapting the economic model to the appropriate parameters for the clustering. 
 
The algorithm and economic model will be applied to the case of Colombia for a variety of industries, showing that the proposed assessment can be used to analyze resource misallocation. In particular we will use information from the Colombian Manufacturing Survey.
 
## Supervision
This project will be supervised by Nicolás Cardozo and David Perez-Reyna (from the Department of Economics).
