### Context

Getting a grasp of propositional logic formula manipulation [1] is usually a challenging task. The purpose of this project is to develop a propositional logic-based game to practice the manipulation of logic formulas.

### Project proposal

The game is similar to tetris, where different propositional letters (e.g., p, q, r, s) and connectors (e.g., or, and, implication) are presented to the player to organize. If the resulting propositions can be reduced to a simpler proposition, then the reduction takes plase. If the propositions reduce to a tautology, then they disappear from the board. If the constructed formulas do not reduce, they start to accumulate on the board. The game is finished when the propositions reach the limit of the board.

### Implementation plan

The project consists in developpping the game and its interaction. The game implementation can be done either on a web or mobile platform
