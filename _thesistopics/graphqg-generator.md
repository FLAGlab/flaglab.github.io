### Context

Testing is a key phase of the software development process. However, to effectively test complex systems (e.g., requiring user interaction), it is necessary automate the test so that they can be executed fast and with confidence on the results. In such complex cases, it is normally necessary to use mockup objects or information that doesn to disrrupt the production environment of the system under test. However, generating such objects for significant tests and border cases is still a challenge.

### Project proposal

With this project we want to build a testing framework to generate mockup/random information on top of the GraphQl APIs

### Implementation plan

This work will take place using JavaScript under the platform of a real software company
