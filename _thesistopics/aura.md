### Context

Reinforcement learning is the mother of all AI algorithms. Therefore, we want to explore its capabilities on robotic environments, and in particular on humanoid environments.

### Project proposal

With this thesis proposal you will be able to work in one of several topics to implement RL algorithms with humanoid robots

- Free movement (walking, moving arms, climbing steps)
- Speech (just talk in spanish, explain its behavior)
- Fullfill tasks (pack elements, fetch elements)


### Implementation plan

- Implement the appropriate RL algorithm for the task at hand

### Background and Literature
