### Context

Distribution networks are a key component of different procesess, such as supply chains, and resource allocation. Normally, distribution networks are modelled and reasoned about as optimization problems using statistical models or stochastic processes.  

### Project proposal

In this project we want to explore the use of reinforcement lerning agents to model and execute distribution networks. The hypotesis of this work is that we are able to be at least as effective in the netweork optimization than typical optimization approaches, with the advantage of not requiring a model.

Furthermore, using RL it should be possible to extend the networks that we can execute, for example, by adding more restrictions to the network, or including temporal constraints, without requiring major changes to the agents.

### Implementation plan

The implementation of this work will be based on the development of Q-learning based agents to run on multiple distribution networks models.
