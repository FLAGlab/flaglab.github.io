### Context

ML is awesome!....

Unfortunately all of its might is becomming more and more unreachable only available for evry large companies with incredible computing and storage capabilities, leaving us average joes out of the loop.

But fear not, we're gonna solve that problem

### Project proposal

TinyML has become quite popular over the last couple of year as an alternative to enable powerfull ML capabilities in contrained computing capabilities. The idea of this thesis is to explore, evaluate, and push the state of the art in tinyML algorithms to use them in IoT scenarios and devices.

### Implementation plan

The idea of the thesis is to:

- gather information of existign tinyML models and their characteristics
- put algorithms and models to the test by implementing them and deploy them in different devices
- evaluate the performance of the algorithms and models in completing different tasks under restricted computing devices with different characteristics
