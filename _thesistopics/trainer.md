### Context

Competitive programming conssist in the resulution of problems using differnt algorithmic techniques. Competitions usually strive to promptly find problem solutions that are general (to the problem specification), and of quality (with respect to the algorithmic complexity). To do this, one must practice in different areas, such as algorithmic theory, algorithm development, and complexity as well as in problem-solution identification, and fast coding.

### Project proposal

The purpose of this thesis is to develop a training platform for competitive programers. The platform should be available to programmers 24/7, offering the possibility to train all the different required skills aforementioned.

In particular some of the modules that could be developed are, problem-solution identification, progress tracking, or problem solution helper.

### Implementation plan

The project should be implemented using cutting edge web technology --that is, use Rust [1] to be deployed in the web using WebAssembly [2]

### Background and Literature

- [1] [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- [2] [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org)
