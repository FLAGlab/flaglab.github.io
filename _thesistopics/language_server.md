### Context

A big part for the acceptance of programming language is the development tools around the language. One of the pivotal tools to ease the learning curve for a language is its IDE.

### Project proposal

In this project we want to gear the VSCode IDE for the Athena theorem prover and language.

### Implementation plan

There are many different features to tackle with the creation of a language server, here we list some of the features to take into account and (possibly) develop during the project:

- Build a working Language Server for Athena
- Add linter characteristics
- Add semantic checks
- Add proof results
- Improve the error messages for the compiler
- Add export characteristics to:
  - Latex
  - Markdown
  - HTML5
