### Context

In the context of the interdiciplinary group on robotics, we want to look into the API interface to control the Pepper robot, in order to improve its functionality and improve its quality.

### Project proposal

The objective of this project is to completely re-design the architecture used for the control's API of the Pepper robot project. The current architecuter is a mix of components implemented using different technologies loosly integrated. With the new design we hope to re-implement existing components in a single technological base, and to bypass unnecesary modules in order to increase the quality of the system, improve its performance, and implement new functionality.

### Implementation plan

The implementation of the project will follow the implementation structure already set by the Pepper architecture, with a redesign of of the control components, redefinition of the API, and a new implementation in Python
