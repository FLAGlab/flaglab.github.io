### Context

Swarm behavior systems involves creating systems that mimic the collective behavior of social creatures like ants or bees to solve complex problems. These systems are composed of numerous decentralized, self-organized agents that interact with each other and their environment, leading to emergent, global behavior. This approach is particularly useful in situations where centralized control is difficult or inefficient, such as in robotics, optimization, and resource allocation.

### Project proposal

In this thesis we will explore teh communication aspect of swarm environments in heterogeneous application environments, that is, the exploration of diverse distributed algorithms in swarm environments so that members of the swarm have different responsabilities and capabilities, that can changes as the result of communication, or even be transfered between the members to better suited members.

### Implementation plan

For the implementation of the algorithms we will strive to use Elixir as a development platform.
The work of the thesis will use a simulator created for the evaluation of swarm behavior algorithms.
