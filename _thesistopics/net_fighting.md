### Context

One of the many successes of Reinforcement Learing (RL) is the development of agents optimize for games, and in particular to play Atari games. Many different algorithms, plain and deep, exist for clasic games like packman or Mario Bros.

However, the exploration of RL algorithms for more modern and arguably complex has not yet been widely explored.

### Project proposal

In this project, we want to explore different RL algorithms to play more advance video games, as the case of Street Fighter. To do so, we will implement different Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms (DQN) [2], and compare their performance as Street Fighter players.

### Implementation plan

The implementation cycle for each algorithm will include:

- Definition of the algorithm
- Adaptation to Street Fighter
- Performance evaluation
