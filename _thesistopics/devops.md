### Context

Companies are faced with the problem of rapid development, having to release new and improve features continuously. While different software development process have been design to accelerate the development, such processes cannot be stand-alone. These processes need to be accompanied with maintenance and quality assurance processes. Continuous integration processes, and later DevOps [1], have been proposed for this purpose.

### Project proposal

In this project we want to analize and implement tools to support DevOps processes, evaluating the benifits of adopting these practices for development companies. Additionally, we will evaluate how tools and processes must scale as companies do over time.

### Implementation plan

- Analysis of DevOps practices for companies
- Design of maintenance, continuous integration, quality assurance, and deployment processes and tools
- Implementation of supporting tools for DevOps
- Evaluation of DevOps tools' benefits in real-world scenarios with companies
