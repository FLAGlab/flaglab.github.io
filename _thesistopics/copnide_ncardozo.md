### Context
Program development still uses an abstraction created for typewriters. However, now a days, programming so much more sofisticated than simple text based interactions. Different programming paradigms and models require novel ways to think and express programs in such a way that the program construction task is eased. 

### Project proposal
The FLAG lab is working on the development of the Context-oriented programming paradigm, and with it different programming models.

The objective of this project, is to take one of such models, namely the Context Petri nets model, and create a new IDE that enables the explicit interaction and definition of contexts as reified by their Petri nets abstraction.

### Implementation plan
The development of this project includes:
  - Creating an three-view interface for the definition of contexts (Petri nets), behavioral adaptations (methods) and their associations (context dependency relations).
  - Expand the definition of the Context Traits programming language to use the Context Petri nets run-time model
  - Coupling the definition of the objects in the IDE with a running program reified in Context Traits
