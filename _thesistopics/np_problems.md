### Context

NP-problems are the holy grail in computer science. Thankfully, there are many of these problems, and no concrete solution for them. Nonetheless, we can approximate solutions for many of the problems, that while not exact, offer at least an idea of how the problem can be solved in a set of restricted cases.

### Project proposal

The objective of this project is to develop heuristic algorithms that can be applied (modulo a morphism) to different known NP-problems.

### Implementation plan

1. Implement heuristic
2. Select a corpus of NP-problems
3. Evaluate the heuristic with respect to known "solutions" to the problem
