### Context

Post-quantum cryptography has become more important than ever with the arrival of quantum computers. Quantum attacks based on Shor's algorithms are no longer a threat but a reality. As a consequence the importance of developping post-quantum cryptography algorithms will become standard practice.

However, the implementation of post-quantum cryptography algorithms is still in its infancy (even though the tooling for it has existend for a while). And there is no standard on the quality or easy of its use.

### Project proposal

The objective of this thesis is to create a platform to evaluate the tools and languages to implement post-quantum cryptography algorithms. The platform should enable the empirical evaluation of the differnt tools such as Magma [1] and SageMath [2].

### Implementation plan

- Implement a web platform to evaluate different post-quantum platforms
- Design a usability questionaire for each of the platforms
- Design the backend to collect all data by participants
- Design a data-analysis framework (a.k.a, due some data science) to extract statistical information fron responses
