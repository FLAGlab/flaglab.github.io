### Context

The AI hype is starting to find its limits. A reason for these limits comes from the lack of appropriate programming models to represent and express the concepts of learning algorithms. One example of this appears in Reinforcement Learning (RL) [1] programs, which often lack the standards and quality od regular software projets.

This problem arises, in part, from the poor tools to express and represent the programs built using RL techniques.

### Project proposal

In this project we are going to implement an analysis framework tool to help use reason about RL programs in terms of their execution [2], being able to pause and modify program values and code, and to analyze the quality in terms of software metrics.

### Implementation plan

- Implement and IDE for RL program analysis
- Integrate execution analysis for RL programs
- Integrate a quality analysis for RL programs

### Background and Literature
