### Context
Logic is the foundation of all computer science, yet almost all proofs are done with pen and paper instead of using a computer to do them automatically.

Although deciding whether a boolean formula is satisfiable is a NP-complete problem, there are more efficient algorithms than brute force to solve it. Studying and implementing such algorithms would allow to write more efficient methods to decide if a proposition is always truth and thus be able to perform some formal proofs automatically and efficiently instead of using truth tables to do so.

### Project proposal
This project will be based around studying algorithms to decide if a proposition is always true or if a proposition is satisiable. Benchmarks and complexity analysis for such algorithms will be done to decide which algorithm has a better memory and time performance.

### Implementation plan
- Make a literature review of the existing algorithms to solve the boolean satisfiability problem.
- Make a literature review of alternative algorithms to decide if a proposition is always true.
- Compute the complexity for each one of these algorithms.
- Implement and benchmark such algorithms to decide which one is the most efficient.
