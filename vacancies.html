    <h2>Ph.D. Teaching Assistant Position</h2>
</p>
<br>

<p>
   <b>Description:</b>
    We are looking for a motivated Ph.D student to join the FLAG research lab at Universidad de los Andes, as a teaching Ph.D. assistant working with Prof Nicol√°s Cardozo. 
    FLAGlab is an interdisciplinary research group focusing on the fundamental aspects of programming languages, algorithms, and artificial intelligence in computer science. Prospective candidates are expected to contribute to the group's research efforts. The current position is open to work on the topic of program analysis, as described next. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Research topic:</b>
    The candidate will work on the general area of program analysis. In particular, we are working on improving the development of multi-language codebases, as for example in the domain of mobile apps. The objective of this project is to propose new cross-language program analysis techniques to tackle the difficulties in maintaining and evolving systems' functionality across code-bases in different programming languages.
    The goal of the project is to research the simultaneous reasoning in different programming language semantics.
    To attain this goal the candidate will develop analysis tools and methods to detect, track, and recommend concrete code snippets across different programming languages, effectively enabling their co-evolution.
    <br>
    The work will continue our research direction on cross-language code clone detection, and will work on mobile phone platforms as application domain, but other domains can be explored (e.g., scientific libraries, multi-language parsers/compilers).
    <br>
    The position is offered for 4 years, as a teaching research assistant (knowledge of the fundamentals of computer science is required). This position covers the program's full tuition and stipend. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Requirements:</b>
    Applicants should hold a Master degree in computer science or a related discipline (demonstrating a strong computing component/knowledge), demonstrating to be at the top of your class, and proof of english proficiency and scientific writing. 
    Note that we have a continuous application process. You are able to apply to the Ph.D. program at any moment, but you are required to follow the vetting process of the admission requirements at Universidad de los Andes.
