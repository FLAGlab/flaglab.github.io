Quantum computing is among us! With the advent of quantum computing it is becoming pivotal to understand the innerworks of the algorithms and programs used in this technology.

The use of Quantum technologies poses a thread on the security of current computing systems. Therefore, (post-)quantum cryptography is a matter concerning all professionals. We covet a stronger alliance between computer scientists and mathematicians that can help develop the crypto systems necessary for this new era of secure systems even if Quantum computing-based attacks are used.

Additionally, we are interested on the development and optimization of new Quantum programming algorithms that can increase the productivity in different application domains.

#### Coding Theory

We follow closely the NIST, its contests, and the brand new research that gets published in the area. Our main focus is Coding Theory. Nonetheless, when working with allies we thrive in crypto analysis.

### Quantum Computing

As part of the development in post-quantum cryptography, we are also leveraging quantum computing technologies to have advancements in the development of quantum systems. Our work is pslit into three: (1) studying the algorithmic properties of quantum programs to design new ways to interact and develop such systems. (2) analyzing the properties of quantum systems to design the theory around such properties, and to assure them. (3)The development of machine learning algorithms (in collaboration with the AI pillar) that use or are completely driven by quantum technology.
