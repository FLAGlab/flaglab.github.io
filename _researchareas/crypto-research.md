Quantum programming is among us. With the advent of quantum computing is becoming pivotal to understand the innerworks of the algorithms and programs used in this technology. Our particular interest is on the development and optimization of new Quantum algorithm that can increase the productivity in different application domains.

Moreover, the use of Quantum technologies has set a thread on the security of current computing systems. therefore, for us, (post-)quantum cryptography is a matter concerning all professionals. We covet a stronger alliance between computer scientists and mathematicians that can help develop the crypto systems necessary for this new era.

#### Coding theory

We follow closely the NIST, its contests, and the brand new research that gets published in the area. Our main focus is Coding Theory. Nonetheless, when working with allies we thrive in crypto analysis.
