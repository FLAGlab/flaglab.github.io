Quantum computing is among us! With the advent of quantum computing it is becoming pivotal to understand the innerworks of the algorithms and programs used in this technology.

The use of Quantum technologies poses a thread on the security of current computing systems. Therefore, (post-)quantum cryptography is a matter concerning all professionals. We covet a stronger alliance between computer scientists and mathematicians that can help develop the crypto systems necessary for this new era of secure systems even if Quantum computing-based attacks are used.

Additionally, we are interested on the development and optimization of new Quantum programming algorithms that can increase the productivity in different application domains.

#### Coding theory

We follow closely the NIST, its contests, and the brand new research that gets published in the area. Our main focus is Coding Theory. Nonetheless, when working with allies we thrive in crypto analysis.
