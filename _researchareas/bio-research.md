## BioInformatics

The Bioinformatics pilar of the FLAGlab focuses on the design new algorithms and tools addressing different bioinformatics problems. Our work is focused around the Next Generation Sequencing Experience Platform ([NGSEP](https://sourceforge.net/p/ngsep/wiki/Home/)).

#### Get into the code

To check out our current work you can go to our dedicated [github repositories](https://github.com/orgs/FLAGlab/teams/bioinformatics)

## Algorithms

We are interested in different aspects of algorithm design, such as creating new algorithms to solve known problems, or algorithmic complexity.
