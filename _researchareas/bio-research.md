## BioInformatics

The Bioinformatics pilar of the FLAGlab focuses on the design new algorithms and tools addressing different bioinformatics problems. Our work is focused around the Next Generation Sequencing Experience Platform ([NGSEP](https://sourceforge.net/p/ngsep/wiki/Home/)).

#### Get into the code

To check out our current work you can go to our dedicated [github repositories](https://github.com/orgs/FLAGlab/teams/bioinformatics)

## Algorithms

The algorithms pilar of the FLAG lab is centered on the analysis, design, and development of exact and approximated algorithms and data structures to address the complex computational problems posed by the increasing volume and interconection of data.

### Competitive Programming

One of ousr lines of work is dedicated in efficient algorithm design for real world problems. We actively participate in programming competitions (international: [ICPC](https://icpc.global), local: [CCPL](https://www.programmingleague.org) and [RPC](http://redprogramacioncompetitiva.com))
