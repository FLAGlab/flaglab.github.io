The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research pillar at the FLAG lab, focuses in the development of cutting edge fundamental reserach approaches for the advancement of this important domain.
Furthermore, we are interested in the intersection of AI and Machine Learning with other disciplines in the domain of computer science such as recommender systems, smart cities, and the Internet of Things, to mention a few.
These approaches are applied in a variety of domains including technology enchanced learning, software verification, and programming languages.

### Natural Language Processing

Development of NLP and Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Reinforcement Learning

We are actively working on Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques in collaboration with the Science Foundation Ireland center for research training in AI, Trinity College Dublin, and the [Software Design lab](https://thesoftwaredesignlab.github.io) at Uniandes.

We are interested in developpign: (1) New RL algorithms to improve learning and explore interaction between agents. (2) programming languages with the appropriate abstractions to express/hide the complexity of RL algorithms. (3) Software development and analysis tools for RL programs, with emphasis on software quality and debugging.

### Machine Learning

Studying the use and development of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms for both Deep and regular Neural Networks.
