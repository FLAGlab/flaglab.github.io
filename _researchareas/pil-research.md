The PiL pilar of FLAGlab focuses on the design and implementation of new programming languages and paradigms for the development of new generation software systems.

Our work is centered in the development of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), type systems, and the
verification and validation of software sytems at the programming language level. We are currently working programming languages for smart, interconnected, and next generation environments.

### Smart Environments

Our main application domain is on smart adaptive systems, which include smart cities, smart transport, IoT and cyberphysical environments. In this domain area we work on Context-oriented Programming (COP) languages as a driver to foster smarter systems that can react to the conditions of their surrounding environment and offer the most appropriate behavior to users.

### Interconnected Environments

We are currently developing new programming models for distributed systems tailored to manage uncertainty from the environment.

Along side with the developing of programming languages we are developping new software verification mechanims to assure properties about the system execution. The main work in this area is called Avva a set of modules to verify the behavior of actor-based distributed systems build on top of Athena.
