For us, post quantum cryptography is a matter concerning all professionals. We covet a stronger alliance between computer scientists and mathematicians that can help develop the crypto systems necessary for this new era.

#### Coding theory

We follow closely the NIST, its contests, and the brand new research that gets published in the area. Our main focus is Coding Theory. Nonetheless, when working with allies we thrive in crypto analysis.
