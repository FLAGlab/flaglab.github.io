### Context

Companies are faced with the problem of rapid development, having to release new and improve features continuously. While different software development process have been design to accelerate the development, such processes cannot be stand-alone. These processes need to be accompanied with by quality assurance processes. Continuous integration processes, adn later DevOps [1] have been proposed for this purpose.

### Project proposal

In this project we want to evaluate and implement the different characteristics of DevOps to evaluate its benifits in the context of new companies. Additionally, we will evaluate how tools and processes must scale as companies do over time.
