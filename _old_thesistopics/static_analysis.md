### Context

Automated maintenance and program comprehention are the most challenging and time-consuming tasks in software engineering development. To address such challenges different static analysis and automated validation techniques have been proposed. This project is based on the use, and experimentation of novel static analysis techniques for the evaluation of programs targeting mobile platforms.

### Project proposal

Differential static analysis [1] is a technique for the analysis of programs throughout the history of their evolution. Specifically, this technique looks at differences between two versions of a programs. While syntactic analysis can offer some insight about programs' evolution, to have a better understanding of the program and assure its quality, we would like to have semantic information. However, little work has been done in semantic differential program analysis [2].

In this project we want to take existing techniques further by developing semantic differential analysis techniques for program versions written in different programming languages.

### Implementation plan

- Evaluation of existing differential analysis techniques
- Exploration of cross-language techniques [3]
- Definition of cross-language techniques for mobile platforms
- Creation of a corpus of cross-language multi-version development technique
- Evaluation of the designed techniques over the corpus
