### Context

Students learning to program are challenge with learning fundamental programming concepts as well as the syntax of the programming language they use. Learning the two concepts at the same time can be overwhelming, therefore, providing timely and effective support to students is key to ensure their process.

### Project proposal

The objective of this project is to develop an automated tool to support students by answering their language and programming concept-related questions.

### Implementation plan

The project will use an automated service bot [1] able to recognize and characterize students's questions and provide an effective answer for their question. The bot is to be integrated as a slack app [2] to make it more accessible to a broad audience of students.
